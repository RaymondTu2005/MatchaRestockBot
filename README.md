This project is a matcha restock / notifier bot that automatically parses HTML / JSON data from popular websites such as https://www.sazentea.com/en/, https://www.marukyu-koyamaen.co.jp/english/shop/products/catalog/matcha, and https://ippodotea.com/collections/matcha.
The purpose of this project is to help identify when restocks happen so that users can purchase said products, especially during times of short-stocking. The program is coded in Java, and uses libraries such as Gson, Jsoup, PostgreSQL database, and Spring (Spring Boot) and Maven for build automation & dependencies.
